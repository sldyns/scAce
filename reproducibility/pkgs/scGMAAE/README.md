# scGMAAE: Gaussian Mixture Adversarial Autoencoder for scRNA-seq Data
All source codes are in code.rar, and you can run scGMAAE with run_scGMAAE.py.
Here, we provide a sample dataset baron-human.h5 in the data folder , which has two parts of data, the gene expression matrix and the real cell type.
scGMAAE is built on Pytorch, and you should install Pytorch before running it.
